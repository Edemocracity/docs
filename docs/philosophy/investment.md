# Investing

Vocdoni is born from the activist movement. We seek to build effective tools to empower the civil society from the bottom up and it has never been our goal to have a lucrative product.

We understand that certain financial objectives are not aligned with our vision. It is critical to us to be soverign over our output in order to prevent the corruption of it at any level. Therore, until now we've refused external investment, and have been exclusively funded through donations  ... Thank you! ðŸ’•

We're not opposed to external investment in itself, but we're not willing to dilute control via venture capital.
