# Documentation

This documentation repo uses [Docsify.](https://docsify.js.org/#/)

It is an static site that parses the markdown files on runtime.

Is worth tacking a look to understand how it works.

>This documentation lives inside the `/docs` folder [in order to use Github pages](https://help.github.com/en/articles/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-github-pages#publishing-your-github-pages-site-from-a-docs-folder-on-your-master-branch).

## Preview locally

To test locally you can run the http server of you choice at the `/docs` directory.

If you want to [install docsify npm package](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart?id=quick-start) globally, there is a [convinent script](https://docsify.js.org/#/quickstart?id=preview-your-site) to run a server with hot-reload. Otherwise there is no need to install docsify.

Alternatively [npm http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or
Python's [SimpleHTTPServer](https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html) are convinient options.
