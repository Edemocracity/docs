# Overview

Vocdoni is an Open Platform, where everybody can participate, including voters, institutions and third parties. For this reason, it is crucial that any actor on the ecosystem can integrate its own tools and services to make decentralized governance possible, the way they need it.

Note: The following section is a work in progress.

## Voting as a service

See the [Voting as a Service](/integration/voting-as-a-service) section for a tutorial on how to run an election process using NodeJS.

## Registry backend

See the [Registry backend](/integration-registry-backend) section for examples on how to generate registration tokens for community members, using the Vocdoni Manager backend.

We are working on further integration examples. Meanwhile, you can also check the example sections of the following libraries:

- [DVote JS](https://gitlab.com/vocdoni/dvote-js/-/blob/master/example/index.ts)
- [DVote Flutter](https://gitlab.com/vocdoni/dvote-flutter/-/tree/master/example/lib)
