# Prototype

The UI design is iterated using Sketch.Systems and Figma

## Formally specified UI

To guarantee that all the state permutations are taken in consideration we are working on having the [UI formally specified](https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/formally-specifying-uis/) by using [Sketch.sytems](https://sketch.systems/)

We're using our own convention to enhance clarity and make use of the Sketch.systems prototype capabilities

- [Sketch.systems convention](/design/sketch-systems-convention)
- [Reference app spec](https://sketch.systems/xavivives/sketch/7a8e253cd53a24c5e19e737505162fc4)

## Prototyping

Figma is used to define the UI layout and the ahesteics.
