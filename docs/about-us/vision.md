# Vision

Vocdoni Roots MTÃœ is the  non-profit that protects the intellectual property and the values of Vocdoni **Open Stack**.

Vocdoni in Esperanto means _"to give voice"_

> Our aim is exactly that - to give voice to those who are prevented, whether overtly or covertly, from the exercise of their fundamental right to self-determination.

We want to empower civil society from the bottom up. We understand that decentralization is the only medium to achieve and sustain that.
