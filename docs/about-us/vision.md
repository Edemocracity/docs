# Vision

Vocdoni in Esperanto means _"to give voice"_

> Our aim is exactly that - to give voice to those who are prevented, whether overtly or covertly, from the exercise of their fundamental right to self-determination.

We want to empower civil society from the bottom up. We understand that decentralization is the only medium to achieve and sustain that.

We are building a decentralized, anonymous, secure voting platform that is geared towards mass adoption, because we believe anyone should have the ability to participate in governance without fear of censorship, coercion or fraud.
