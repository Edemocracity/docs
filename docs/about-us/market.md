# Market and traction

The combination of technologies and methodologies employed in the Vocdoni architecture has been carefully selected to enable national-scale decision making processes. Its potential users are therfore any organization of any size. From a single individual/bot to a nation state.

We understand that a centralized voting solution still has an advantage with respect to user experince, but there are serveral cases where transparency and censorship are more important variables to consider.

There is an increase in censorhip and mass surveillance worldwide, and a lot of organizations do not have a medium to develop under these regimes. We will give them a voice.

We believe that once a decentralized alternative exists the population will demand more transparent processess. Solutions that are not verifiable end-to-end will no longer be an option.
