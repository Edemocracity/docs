# Business model

It is critical for our venture to be a sustaniable project.

Once a production solution exists, maintaining the economic soverigntiy of the project can be achieved through diferent channels.

Our potential customers are the organizations that want to use the platform. The organization pays for the full cost of the process. Users never pay.

While the infrastructure is open and descentralized, there are external services that may be needed. Therefore we provide complete solutions or services for :

- Infrastructure
- Integration with third parties (organization databases, identity verification services, payment channels )
- Tools for managing census
- Consultancy

Aditionally there are potential ways to monetize by using the decentralized network itself.
