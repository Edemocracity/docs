# How we work

## Ideals

We share very strong ideals among us

- We want **effective** change in how civil society organizes **itself**
- Decentralization is the way to change, but we're aware that its a bumpy and long road, taking straight paths is sometimes needed.
- Transparency above anything
- Trust before hierarchies
- We believe in an open-source approach to creation
- We don't sell, nor over-promise. Instead, we communicate things as we see them. With its pros and cons.

## Balance

We want a sustainable work-life balance

- We encourage the use of working hours for learning related stuff to your work and our collective mission.
- We encourage a balanced lifestyle and we suggest a daily average of 6 working hours
- As of today, everyone gets paid the same.

## Coordination

- We are fully autonomous and responsible individuals, therefore, nothing mandates days, schedules, or hours that you work
- We don't like process, but we're not afraid of it if is needed.
- Our communications are 80% online through channels like Matrix/Wire chats and Mumble calls

## Development practices

- Open-source everything
- Test-driven development
- Integration and unit testing
- Well documented and maintained APIs
- Well documented reasoning behind decisions
