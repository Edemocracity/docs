# Guidelines

(Good praxis to keep a consistent documentation goes here)

## Structure

The side-bar hierchy should be a mapping of the folder hierchy.

Don't forget to update the `/docs/_sidebar.md` after adding or changing a file.

## Naming

I suggest using [kebab-case](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11273282/whats-the-name-for-hyphen-separated-case/12273101) as naming convention. It seems to be the Docsify standard and its highly readable.

```example
kebab-case-file-name.md
```

## Linting and formating

If you are using VS Code, we highly recommend to install the following extensions, to leverage most of the work for keeping the docs nice and tiddy...

- [Markdown formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tehnix.vscode-tidymarkdown)
