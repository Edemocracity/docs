# Entity metadata

`The current contents are a work in progress`

An entity is an organizer and the ultimate responsable of a process.
One entity can have an arbitrary number of processes.

## Entity

Any `Entity` have associated several metadata.

Most of the metadata is necessary to provide alternative censorship resistant channels of communications between the Entity and the user.

The data in itself or a hash of it is stored in the blockchain.

---

## Resolver

A resolver is a smart-contract in charge of returning the required data from the user.

Several resolver contracts may exist, they all need to conform the same interfaces, specified by Vocdoni.

We make use of ENS resolvers interfaces, but not necessarily use ENS domains (see below)

A resolver stores each entity data into a record addressed by an `entityId`. If we use the ENS domains the `entityId` is the [ENS node](https://docs.ens.domains/terminology), otherwise, the `entitiyId` is the hash of the address that created the entity.

### Interface: Storage of text records

[EIP 634: Storage of text records in ENS](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-634) is convenient to store arbitrary data. It is used as simple key-value storage.

Vocdoni specific keys (`vndr.vocdoni.key`) are represented as JSON objects.

`WIP` Content-addressed data (hashes) with not specfic hash function are referenced using [Mulistream/Multicodec](https://github.com/multiformats/multistream). They use the suffix `.hash`

If there is a specific codec for the hash function (in case we want to provide multiple options to be resolved) it should be suffixed with its protocol `.http`, `.bzz`, `.ipfs` ...

```solidity

function text(bytes32 node, string key) constant returns (string text);

```

### Interface: Storage of lists of text

This is necessary in order to minimize the amount of data to write when the metadata can be splitted.
The user is responsble for managing the indexes, the array does not move its elements.

> The implementation does not exists yet and the API may differ from the final implementation

The behaviour wants to mimic `The storage of text records`

``` solidity

function listText(bytes32 node, string key, uint256 index) constant returns (string text);

function list(bytes32 node, string key) constant returns (string [] text);

```
### Suggested keys

## Data-schema

### Gateway bootnodes

Gateways bootnodes are servers trusted by the Entity

- They provide a list of potential gateways to the client
- They provide the gateways the necessary information to join the network

The data is fetched directly from the blockchain, otherwise the user may not be able to fetch the gateway data because she doesn't have access to the gateway...

It uses the `Storage of lists of text interface`

```json
    {
    "pubKey": "public key", //used to encrypt the communication between the bootnode and the gateway
    "updateProto": "pss",
    "updateParams": { "updateFrequency": 10000, "topic":"vocdoni_gateways", "address":"0x" },
    "difficulty": integer,
    "host": "IP/DNS",
    "port": port,
    "protocol": "http/https/ws"
  }
]
```

### Feed

The `Feed` serves the purpose of having a uni-directional censorship resistant communication channel between the `Entity` and the `user`.
You can imagine it as an RSS feed

We follow the [JSON feed specification](https://jsonfeed.org/version/1)

### Actions

Actions are stored in IPFS/SWARM its reference is stored in `vndr.vocdoni.actions.ipfs`

```json

## ENS

>ENSâs job is to map human-readable names like âalice.ethâ to machine-readable identifiers such as Ethereum addresses, content hashes, and metadata. ENS also supports âreverse resolutionâ, making it possible to associate metadata such as canonical names or interface descriptions with Ethereum addresses.

ENS exist to suit our exact purpose, we endorse it, but we may not make complete use of it.

### Overview

There are two smart contracts that make it work:

> The `ENS registry` is deliberately straightforward and exists only to map from a name to the resolver responsible for it.

> `Resolvers` are responsible for the actual process of translating names into addresses. Any contract that implements the relevant standards may act as a resolver in ENS.

The usual interaction will be:

1. Ask to the registry what resolver is responsible for a domain
2. Ask for a property of this resolver. Usually, this is an address, but it can be anything. And this is what we can make use of

![Basic ENS interaction](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/_OPPzaxTxKggx9HuxloeWtK8ggEfIIBKRCEA6BKMwZdzAfUpIY6cz7NK5CFmiuw7TwknbhFNVRCJsswHLqkxUEJ5KdRzpeNbyg8_H9d2RZdG28kgipT64JyPZUP--bAizozaDcxCq34)

### No Mainnet

Vocdoni may be used in different networks other than the Ethereum Mainnet.

This presents a potential attack vector where a malicious entity supplanting a Mainnet domain in an alternative network. This is is very relevant to us because we will have users that are not literate about it, and communicating the difference between networks is very hard.

Therefore, we understand that we should only make use of ENS domains in the Ethereum Mainnet, independently from the network where the rest of Vocdoni smart-contracts are deployed.

At the same time, we understand that some implementations of Vocdoni may not have a use for ENS, therefore we should not rely on it for any fundamental architectural design.

We do make use of the ENS resolvers and we follow the same architecture since there isre a lot of value in potentially using ENS domains.

### ENS domain authentication

If we don't make use of the Mainnnet/ENS-domain the `node` is a hash of the address that created the resolver record for the entity.

`ENS public resolver` permission access to edit and add records is through the ENS registry. The `msg.sender` [needs to match](https://github.com/ensdomains/resolvers/blob/180919414b7f1dec80100b4aeff081d5afa8f3ce/contracts/PublicResolver.sol#L23) the owner of the ENS domain

If we don't make use of the Mainnet/ENS-domain, this gets on the way and the contract should be modified to check if the node is the hash of the msg.sender

ENS resolver

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner(bytes32 node) {
    require(ens.owner(node) == msg.sender);
    _;
}
```

No ENS resolver

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner(bytes32 node) {
    require(node == keccak256(msg.sender) );
    _;
}

```

### Comparison

We basically make use of ENS resolvers to store metadata.
Some implementations may decide to make use of ENS domains

## Subscription

A user can subscribe to any entity she pleases.

Because the resolver architecture, metadata of different entities may exist in different resolver contracts.

The client app stores the resolver and the entityId of the entity and fetches the data when it needs.

### Entities curated lists

In order to provide an entry point for a user to find entities to subscribe we have `Entities curated lists`.

These are smart contracts that conform to a specific interface that allows users to fetch the available entities of this list.

- An entity itself can a have pointer to a list of trusted lists of entities
- Can be used for testing scenarios
- The owner of the list can establish a KYC process, or complex logic to appear on the list

#### Nested entities

In the `keys` example above I suggested `vndr.vocdoni.entities.trusted`. Which is a key that points to an `Entities curated list`.

This allows each entity to define its own list of trusted/child/supported entities. Is a very simple discovery/filtering/reputation mechanism that we can make use of while we wait for more complex Identity support.

- A big organization could list all its departments. And each department could do the same to its sub-departments and so on...
- It is a very elegant way to filter, especially if a list is big, there are entities with similar names...
- It does not require almost any UI implementation on the client side.
- Can be used to find additional trusted gateways in case the ones of the current entity are down.
